Security & Privacy
==================

Is it really more secure?
-------------------------

The secret keys stored on the device are specific to the user and the website, and their access is protected by either biometrics or PIN code.

In other words, even if your device is stolen, you could not be impersonated, except if they also know your PIN.

It is a two factor authentication in a single step. The first factor is something you have (the device) and the other is something you are (using fingerprint or face recognition) or alternatively something you know (device's PIN code).

Let's quickly review how it protects against common security threats.
